# My-Capstone Project Repository
This is my first attempt using Git and GitHub Respository for my capstone 2024

# If we want to add new lines:

1. git status (to check the file status, which file is been modified)
2. git add <file_name> (tell git to add the particular file)
3. git commit -m "<user_cmmt>"
4. git push (to update the file on GitHub)

*Testing on tcl file* <br>
command use source <tcl_file_name>

# For collaborative REPO
1. create a collab REPO at local and GitHub (team leader create) and invite
2. each members will have a own branch
3. files in the collab REPO can be view only for members
4. to edit the file, members need to clone the file to their local
5. use the cmd *git clone <REPO_URL>* URL can be obtained from the *CODE</>* button at the collab repo
6. to make changes, we need to create branch by using the cmd *git branch*
7. create individual branch, cmd *git branch <branch_name>*
8. go to the branch, cmd *git switch <branch_name>*, then start editing
9. save the file and push
10. git status
11. git add <file_name>
12. git commit -m "cmt"
13. git push origin <branch_name>
